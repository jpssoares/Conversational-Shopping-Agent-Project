# Conversational-Shopping-Agent-Project

Project made by Jo√£o Soares and Ricardo Pereira.

### Env File
Create a .env file with the variables that are in the example. (Given in the labs)

```
API_USER=''
API_PASSWORD=''
```

### Instalation/Setup
First you need to create a python venv.
```
conda create --name <environment_name> --file requirements.txt
```
Then you run that env:
```
conda activate <environment_name>
```
Alternatively, if you already have created a venv, you can check if you have all the required packages.

```
conda install pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can run the program:

```
python app.py
```
